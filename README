== RawReg3 Documentation

Updated to run on Rails 3 and to use OmniAuth for Facebook/Twitter/Linkedin authentication.

If you dislike registration plugins as I do, this code is meant as a starting point for rolling your own and/or grabbing code snippets for your own code.

I often write my own from scratch, so thought it'd be useful to have the basics I always use in one ready to go package. But, it's done as raw code, as each project's needs inevitably evolve in a way that makes plugins a pain. This is mostly here for my own use, but if you find it useful, let me know.

FWIW, I also don't like restful URLs (e.g. /sessions/new & /sessions/create) for user-facing registration actions. Everything herein is done via the default routes and the UserController. I usually do top-level, human-friendly mappings for '/login', '/signup', etc. in config/routes.rb too.

Another non-standard-Rails thing is the use of singular table names, which I very much prefer-- should be easy to change if you want plural table names. Finally, I prefer one 250 line controller to 10 25-line controllers.

If you want to start from scratch, I recommend this great tutorial, which I've found useful and whose approach I like.

Finally, these are great docs on OmniAuth integration:

== What the code herein includes

* registration (unique email address, password, and a display name)
* email verification on registration (not fully registered until click on link in email)
* update email address (also gets verified)
* update password (w/ confirmation of old password)
* update other user fields (just name & timezone in the example)
* deleting account (record not actually deleted from db)
* really basic user admin tool

== Files with relevant code

If starting a new project, you can just clone this repo and build off it for your project. If plugging into existing code, here are the relevant files:

app/* ## see all the code under the app directory, especially the controllers and the user model
lib/settings.rb ## a handful of settings to update
db/migrate/*create_users.rb ## see the table definition
lib/settings.rb ## update with your host settings; set a new random secret
config/initializers/active_record_extensions.rb ## non-pluralized table names
config/initializers/mail.rb ## delivery method set to sendmail (using ssmtp)

== To INSTALL

* mysqladmin -u root -p create rawreg_development
* git clone git@github.com:kamali/rawreg3.git rawreg3
* cd rawreg3
* edit config/database.yml with your db user/password info
* rake --trace RAILS_ENV=development db:create db:migrate
* edit config/environment.rb -- change the config.action_controller.session secret
* edit lib/settings.rb to reflect values for your host
* change the secret in lib/settings.rb
* mkdir log
* bundle exec unicorn &  ## or something like:
* sudo /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/bundle exec /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/unicorn_rails -E development -l 127.0.0.1:8080

== Set up SSMTP or similar

* apt-get install ssmtp ## if you don't already have it
To use your GMail account as a relay for testing in dev:
http://www.igvita.com/2007/08/29/ssmtp-relay-mail-delivery-in-rails/

== URLs to view:

http://localhost:8080/user/signup
http://localhost:8080/user/account
http://localhost:8080/user/admin  (to access, "update user set role="admin" where id=NNN")

== What this doesn't handle

* unique username for users (few projects I've done recently desire this), but easily add-able
* profile pages

== Requirements

A user table with email (string), password (string), salt (string), verified (boolean/tinyint) fields.

== To post to Twitter / Facebook

    for a in current_user.authentications
      case a.provider
        when 'facebook' then current_user.facebook(a).feed!(:message => 'Hello, Testing Facebook', :name => 'Lynk' )
        when 'twitter' then current_user.twitter(a).update("Hello, Testing Twitter")
      end
    end

== Other Notes

Add your OAuth keys to config/initializers/omniauth.rb.

There is intentionally nearly zero styling--you'll want to wrap your own stylesheets and CSS around everything.

Tests are up to you for now after modifying the code however you want.

You can add whatever other fields you want in your user table (e.g. full name, location, etc.) Just add them t the schema, and update the edit template.

Session cookies are not encrypted -- by default only user id, display name, and roles are stored in it, so nothing sensitive. Everything else must either be explicitly added to the cookie, or fetched from the db.
